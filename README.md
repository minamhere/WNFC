# WNFC

This is a Tamper Monkey script that will automatically run when you search for a Southwest Points far. 

It requires [Tamper Monkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) to be installed first.

You can install the script manually, or just click [on this link](https://github.com/minamhere/WNFC/raw/master/wnfc.user.js) to let Tamper Monkey figure it out.

It will automatically keep itself updated, as long as you allow Tamper Monkey to auto update scripts. 

Let me know if you find any bugs or situations where it seems to break or provide incorrect data.

Also let me know if there are other things that it can do that might be useful.
